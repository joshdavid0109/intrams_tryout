- Evaluation System: Built-in evaluation system to assess participant performance during tryouts. Customizable evaluation criteria and scoring mechanisms provide objective feedback for each participant.
- Communication Tools: Integrated communication features such as email notifications and announcements to keep participants informed about tryout schedules, updates, and results.
- Data Management: Secure storage and management of participant data, tryout schedules, and evaluation results. Data privacy and security measures ensure confidentiality and compliance with regulations.
- Scalability and Customization: Modular architecture and customizable features to adapt to the evolving needs of SLU's intramural program. Scalable infrastructure supports growth and expansion of the system over time.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
